# Morpeh Tanks
A simple tank game example using [Morpeh ECS framework](https://github.com/scellecs/morpeh),
[Morpeh Helpers](https://github.com/SH42913/morpeh.helpers), 
[Unity Input System](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem) and 
[Tri-Inspector](https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Tri-Inspector). \
It contains usages of Morpeh Providers and examples of ECS Unit tests.

The game has local multiplayer: one input device - one player, currently only keyboard and gamepads are supported.
Be aware, that was just my test job, so the project has no best practices and **must be used only as an example, not as a guide**.

## Broken [Installer] Main prefab
There's possibility to get broken links in Main Installer after import.
To solve this just right click prefab and select `Reimport` action. This action must fix links.
